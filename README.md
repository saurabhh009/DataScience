# Sentiment Analysis for Market Research using SVM Model 
## Importance of Sentiment Analysis 
•	Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for market research as it provides insights into customer attitudes, preferences,	and behavior. 

•	It helps to identify trends, patterns, and areas of improvement, which can be used to make informed business decisions.



## Results
•	The sentiment analysis model built on this dataset shows promising results with an overall accuracy of 94%. 

•	The precision and recall scores for positive and negative classes are also high, indicating that the model is able to classify the reviews with good accuracy.

•	The word cloud generated for positive and negative reviews shows the most commonly occurring words in the respective categories.

•	Overall, the model built on this dataset can be used by companies to analyze customer reviews and improve their product accordingly.

## Analysis Preferred to Validate Sent. Analysis
•	Human Annotation: Use humans to manually label a sample of text data and compare the results to the sentiment analysis output.

•	Precision, Recall, and F1 Score: Use metrics to evaluate the model's accuracy and performance.

•	Confusion Matrix: Use a table to evaluate the model's true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative rates.

•	Cross-validation: Partition data into multiple sets to test the model's accuracy on new data.

•	A/B Testing: Compare the output of two different sentiment analysis models or techniques on the same data.

## Conclusions
•	We performed sentiment analysis on Amazon Alexa product reviews using machine learning techniques.

•	The dataset consisted of 3150 reviews, out of which 2578 were positive and 572 were negative.

•	We performed data cleaning, text preprocessing, and feature engineering on the data to prepare it for machine learning models.

•	We used the LinearSVC model for sentiment analysis and achieved an accuracy of 95.4%.

•	The precision, recall, and F1 score for both classes were also high, indicating good performance of the model.
